Complying with this implementation guide means complying with a number of profiles, extensions, value sets and custom search parameters. This page provides an overview of where this information can be found.
The FHIR artifacts used by Post Acute Orders are organized according to whether the content developed as part of the US Core implementation guides or is specific to this implementation guide.

# Artifact Lists
* Post Acute Order specific Artifacts
* US Core (3.0.0 - R4 based)

Additional information about the use of these artifacts can be found in the main specification.
The artifacts are of four types:
* 	**Profiles** (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html)constrain FHIR resources to reflect PAO requirements
* 	**Extensions** define additional data elements that can be conveyed as part of a resource
* 	**Code Systems** define PAO-specific terminologies to be used in one or more of those profiles
* 	**Value Sets** define the specific subsets of both PALO-defined and other code systems that can be (or are recommended to be) used within one or more profile elements
* 	**Operations** of which there is only one which defines the PAO-specific constraints on the $processMessage operation
