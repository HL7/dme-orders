This specification uses the abbreviation PAO for Post-Acute Orders.
Rendering provider in this specification means the individual or organization that is responsible for providing the services, devices, and/or medications specified in the order.
 This specification is currently undergoing connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process. 
Feedback is welcome and may be submitted as a Jira ticket indicating PAO as the specification. 
This implementation guide is dependent on other specifications. Please submit any comments you have on these base specifications as follows: 
* 	Feedback on the FHIR core specification should be submitted as a Jira ticket with "FHIR Core" as the specification.
* 	Feedback on the US core profiles should be submitted as a Jira ticket with "US Core" as the specification.
