	"introduction": "The Post Acute Orders (POA) specification is an Implementation Guide of the FHIR Specification that provides guidance on exchanging post-acute orders from the ordering provider to the rendering provider.  This communication may be via an intermediary. The goal is to advance the ability for providers to supply services that are medically necessary and appropriate to patients. By enabling ordering providers to communicate orders and supporting documentation in real-time to performing provider , patients can receive appropriate treatment more rapidly and reduce the burden on all provider to comply with documentation requirements."
