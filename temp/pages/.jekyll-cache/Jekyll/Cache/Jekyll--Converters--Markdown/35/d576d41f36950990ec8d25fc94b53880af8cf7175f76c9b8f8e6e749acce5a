<p>This specification is currently undergoing connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process. 
Feedback is welcome and may be submitted through the FHIR change tracker indicating US PAO Orders as the specification. 
This implementation guide is dependent on other specifications. Please submit any comments you have on these base specifications as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feedback on the FHIR core specification should be submitted to the FHIR change tracker with ‚ÄúFHIR Core‚Äù as the specification.</li>
  <li>Feedback on the US core profiles should be submitted to the FHIR change tracker with ‚ÄúUS Core‚Äù as the specification.</li>
  <li>Feedback on profiles from one of the other Da Vinci implementation guides should also be submitted to the FHIR change tracker with the specification set to the appropriate IG.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="content-and-organization">Content and organization</h1>
<p>The implementation guide is organized into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Cases and Overview describes the intent of the implementation guide, gives examples of its use and provides a high-level overview of expected process flow</li>
  <li>Technical Background describes the different specifications this implementation guide relies on and indicates what developers should read and understand prior to implementing this specification</li>
  <li>Formal Specification covers the detailed implementation requirements and conformance expectations</li>
  <li>Artifacts introduces and provides links to the FHIR R4 profiles, operations and other FHIR artifacts used in this implementation guide</li>
  <li>Downloads allows download of this and other specifications as well as other useful files</li>
  <li>Credits identifies the individuals and organizations involved in developing this implementation guide</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h1>
<p>This implementation guide relies on the following other specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FHIR R4 - The current official version of FHIR as of the time this implementation guide was published. See the background page for key pieces of this specification implementers should be familiar with.</li>
  <li>US Core STU3 - The balloted version of US Core based on FHIR R4. This implementation guide will be updated to be based on the final R4 release once it is published.</li>
</ul>
