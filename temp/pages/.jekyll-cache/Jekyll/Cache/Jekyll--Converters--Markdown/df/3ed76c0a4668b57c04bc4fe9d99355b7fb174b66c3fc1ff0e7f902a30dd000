<p>A) We are soliciting input on the exact methods we should use for communicating order updates and cancels</p>
<ol>
  <li>via a message bundle with the same content (in general) as the original message</li>
  <li>via an update to the Task that includes an updated order resource (what about any additional documentation requirements)</li>
  <li>via some other method</li>
</ol>

<p>B) We are soliciting input on the scope of examples necessary to assist the implementer community</p>

<p>C) We are soliciting input on the use of the Subscription resource on the Task resource as a way of communicating updates by the service provider to the ordering provider. While we may recommend the use of a notification with a subsequent request for the current status by the ordering provider, we have made provision for the subscription to request a complete response including the Task and the specific order resource.</p>

<p>D) We request feedback on the specific profiles in this version of the IG.  In particular, please comment on the cardinality constraints and the use of Must Support.</p>

<p>E) Since we plan to add a number of PAO specific value sets in the STU version, please only comment on specific value sets to the extent you have firm recommendations</p>

<p>F) Please comment on the applicability of this IG to all post-acute orders (not just orders for DME and Home Health)</p>

<p>G) The current extension are planned to allow for the specification of</p>
<ol>
  <li>order detail for the ServiceRequest</li>
  <li>
    <p>relevant reviews for all of the order profiles (DeviceRequest, ServiceRequest, MedicationRequest) that may include items such as prior authorization, documentation review, appropriate use reviews.</p>

    <p>Please comment on the need for other specific extension to support the process of ordering post-acute services and devices</p>
  </li>
</ol>
