<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>This is a FHIR R4 Implementation Guide to support the electronic exchange of post acute orders along with the exchange of supporting documentation between the ordering provider and the specific supplier.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The initial version of the implementation guide (IG) will focus on orders and documentation for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Home Health Services.</li>
  <li>This specification is currently undergoing connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.</li>
</ul>

<p>This implementation guide is the result of work sponsored by CMSâ€™s Center for Program Integrity, whose goal is to advance the ability for providerâ€™s to supply services that are medically necessary and appropriate to Medicare Beneficiaries. By enabling provider to communicate orders and supporting documentation in real-time to suppliers, beneficiaries can receive appropriate treatment more rapidly and reduce the burden on providers and suppliers to comply with documentation requirements.</p>
