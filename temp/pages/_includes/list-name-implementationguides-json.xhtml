This is a FHIR R4 Implementation Guide to support the electronic exchange of post-acute orders, along with the exchange of supporting documentation between the ordering provider and the specific supplier.
* The initial version of the implementation guide (IG) will focus on orders and documentation for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Home Health Services.
* This specification is currently undergoing connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.

This implementation guide is the result of work sponsored by CMS's Center for Program Integrity, whose goal is to advance the ability for providers to supply services that are medically necessary and appropriate to Medicare Beneficiaries. By enabling providers to communicate orders and supporting documentation in real-time to suppliers, beneficiaries can receive appropriate treatment more rapidly and reduce the burden on providers and suppliers to comply with documentation requirements.
