    "description": "# General\nThis is a FHIR R4 Implementation Guide to support the electronic exchange of post-acute orders, along with the exchange of supporting documentation between the ordering provider and the specific supplier.\n* The initial version of the implementation guide (IG) will focus on orders and documentation for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Home Health Services.\n* This specification is currently undergoing connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.\n\nThis implementation guide is the result of work sponsored by CMS\u0027s Center for Program Integrity, whose goal is to advance the ability for providers to supply services that are medically necessary and appropriate to Medicare Beneficiaries. By enabling providers to communicate orders and supporting documentation in real-time to suppliers, beneficiaries can receive appropriate treatment more rapidly and reduce the burden on providers and suppliers to comply with documentation requirements.\n\n# Note to balloters \n**Please comment on the existing material and not on items that are know issues or to-dos (these will be addressed in the STU ballot version planned for the Septemeber Ballot Cycle)\nThere is a section of the IG (Requests to Balloters) that solicits feedback from balloters on items of interest to the authors -- please respond with your recommedations**\n\n# Feedback\nComments and suggestions are welcome on our Zulip stream...\nor send a note to rdieterle@enablecare.us\n\n# Change log\n* **0.1.1 (this version):** QA version for the May 2020 ballot cycle\n\n     Note: prior changes consolided into this Ballot for Comment version\n\n# Known issues and to-dos\n* Complex extensions are defined but not added to DeviceRequest, ServiceRequest and MedicationRequest\n* Will add examples during ballot reconciliation\n* Will add specific terminologies and value sets for post-acute orders during ballot reconcilliation",
